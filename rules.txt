Hello there,

The rules of the game are simple:

If you catch a pokemon ball thats one point
If a boulder hits you then you are out
If you touch the lava then you are out
Make sure to hold space so ur jetpack keeps flying up
Every 5 points, the boulders and players speed gets higher so be careful!
Enjoy!
